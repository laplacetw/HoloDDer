### About
We can use it for watching multiple livestreams of Hololive members, or add other YouTube video for watching at the same time. The script will check schedule info on Hololive official website.

The project root has 2 main folders with source code: cloud & local. I made a cloud version for demo, everyone can use it with a Google account. The cloud demo will remember user configuration with a unique hash ID on Google cloud spreadsheet when CLICK "save" button. It `NEVER` keep your email address or other private info.

Check the demo [>>here<<](https://script.google.com/macros/s/AKfycbywEBw2_-AJ5I04qP1EiVUyzWzxRuZEnHTqJeF7hrj8QRQ_bmTWv6R1aZKGXdY-7ddh/exec)
