### About
We can use it for watching multiple livestreams of Hololive members, or add other YouTube video for watching at the same time. The script will check schedule info on Hololive official website.

The project root has 2 main folders with source code: cloud & local. I made a cloud version for public deploy, everyone can use it with a Google account. The cloud version will remember user configuration with a unique hash ID on Google cloud spreadsheet when CLICK "save" button. It NEVER keep your email address or other private info.

So feel free to check the cloud version [>>here<<](https://script.google.com/macros/s/AKfycbywEBw2_-AJ5I04qP1EiVUyzWzxRuZEnHTqJeF7hrj8QRQ_bmTWv6R1aZKGXdY-7ddh/exec) or built a local version yourself.

### Setting (local version)
1. Create a new App Script project on Google Drive
2. Create all files the same as content of folder "local"
3. Add [Cheerio library for Google Apps Script](https://github.com/tani/cheeriogs)
   <br>[Script ID] : 1ReeQ6WO8kKNxoaA_O0XEQ589cIrRvEBA9qcWpNqdOP17i47u6N9M5Xh0
4. Deploy as a web application for yourself
